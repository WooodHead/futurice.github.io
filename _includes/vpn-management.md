VPN Management is a self-service tool for your employees to handle their OpenVPN certificates. The tool consists of two parts, the server and the installation wizard. VPN Management Server provides the backend and a web interface and VPN Configuration Wizard provides the native application for setting up your configurations. The server is integrated into LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for authentication and the keys are stored in a Git repository.

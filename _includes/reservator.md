Reservator is a meeting room display system for tablets. Mount your tablet next to your meeting rooms door, install Reservator and you’re good to go! Reservator uses your Google calendar’s resources for booking so you can use it, for example, for conference rooms, classrooms or for lending a video projector. While using Reservator, you can still book rooms normally through Google Calendar. You can also use the application for reserving other meeting rooms within your company.
